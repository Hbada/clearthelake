# Clear the Lake
Clear the Lake game based on block breaker module during Unity 2D course on udemy by Rick Davidson and Ben Tristem.

The game is designed with three levels.

## Performance
Playable best using http://tiny.cc/ey80az to access a static WebGL version of the game hosted at AWS using automated AWS Amplify steps to 'host a static app' and so far it works well.

## Issues
Upon rearranging levels, for easier through more complex and difficult block arrangements, the first level is now quite difficult because there are so many blocks. The plan is to make the first level slower and single-hit format, level 2 will be normal speed and 2-hit blocks, and level 3 will have some blocks that require 3 hits before they disappear.
