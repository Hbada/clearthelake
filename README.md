# Clear the Lake
Clear the Lake game based on block breaker module during Unity 2D course on udemy by Rick Davidson and Ben Tristem.

The game is designed with three levels.

## Performance
Playable best using http://tiny.cc/ey80az to access a static WebGL version of the game hosted at AWS using automated AWS Amplify steps to 'host a static app' and so far it works well.

## Issues
After a few builds, I rearranged the order of levels to make it easier to finish level 1 but the idea backfired. Level 1 is now quite difficult because there are so many blocks. The plan is to rearrange the levels again and make the level 1 slower and single-hit destruction mode, level 2 will be normal speed and 2-hit blocks, and level 3 will have some blocks that require 3 hits before they disappear.
